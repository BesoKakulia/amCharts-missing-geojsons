This repository contains several missing GeoJsons from "AmCharts maps" library. If your country does not exists in "amCharts" list nor in this list, there are some tips how you can get it without drawing from zero.
1) Find proper GeoJson on internet.
2) Convert TopoJson or other maps formats to GeoJson as I made it. For example I used https://jeffpaine.github.io/geojson-topojson/ to convert these maps from TopoJson to GeoJson.
